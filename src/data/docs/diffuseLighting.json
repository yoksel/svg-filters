  "desc": "<p>This filter primitive lights an image using the alpha channel as a bump map. The resulting image is an RGBA opaque image based on the light color with alpha=1.0 everywhere. The lighting calculation follows the standard diffuse component of the Phong lighting model. The resulting image depends on the light color, light position and surface geometry of the input bump map.</p><p>The light map produced by this filter primitive can be combined with a texture image using the multiply term of the arithmetic feComposite compositing method. Multiple light sources can be simulated by adding several of these light maps together before applying it to the texture image.</p><p>The light source is defined by one of the child elements <code>feDistantLight</code>, <code>fePointLight</code> or <code>feSpotLight</code>. The light color is specified by property <code>lighting-color</code>.</p>",
