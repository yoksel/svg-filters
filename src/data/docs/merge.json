This filter allows us to collapse those into a single image. Although this could be done by using n-1 Composite-filters, it is more convenient to have this common operation available in this form, and offers the implementation some additional flexibility.</p><p>Each <code>feMerge</code> element can have any number of <code>feMergeNode</code> subelements, each of which has an <code>in</code> attribute.</p>",
