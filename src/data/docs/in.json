The value can be either one of six keywords or can be a string which matches a previous result attribute value within the same filter element. If no value is provided and this is the first filter primitive, then this filter primitive will use <code>SourceGraphic</code> as its input. If no value is provided and this is a subsequent filter primitive, then this filter primitive will use the result from the previous filter primitive as its input.</p><p>If the value for result appears multiple times within a given filter element, then a reference to that result will use the closest preceding filter primitive with the given value for attribute result.</p><p>Forward references to results are not allowed, and will be treated as if no result was specified.
